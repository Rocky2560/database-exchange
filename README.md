In the above diagram, the flow of the system is shown in which there are two servers: bigmart server and ekbana server. The bigmart server consists of the Oracle database in which the customer details, sales info, existing and new customer details, bigmart branches, name of items available in their store is stored in the separate table in the database. Also it consists of JAVA api which is developed from the company and is executed and run in the machine in a specific port, these endpoints helps in fetching the required data as shown in figure. In ekbana server, the database exchange project developed from JAVA and the cassandra , elastic search is within it. 

The database exchange sends the request for data(the request consists of date parameters) to the api in bigmart server, it fetches the data directly from Oracle db, mostly to fetch data Select query is passed. The required data is sent to database exchange in encrypted form so that man-in-middle cannot achieve the data. These data are then decrypted using the decrypt code, and sends data to cassandra and elastic search respectively. For data sync, the cronjob is used at the end of the day, and functions of database exchange are executed. Since the Oracle db is not directly contacted from ekbana server, the chances of downtime of Oracle database is zero as the pressure to the server is low. But, the chances of data exchange will fail if Java API becomes down or stuck in the server.
